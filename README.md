**Abstract of the paper.** A multi-static sensing-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network can take advantage of the cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) infrastructure to achieve remarkable diversity gains and reduced power consumption. While the conciliation of sensing and communication requirements is still a challenge, the privacy of the sensing information is a growing concern that should be seriously taken on the design of these systems to prevent other attacks. This paper tackles this issue by assessing the probability of an internal adversary to infer the target location information from the received signal by considering the design of transmit precoders that jointly optimizes the sensing and communication requirements in a multi-static-based cell-free ISAC network. Our results show that the multi-static setting facilitates a more precise estimation of the location of the target than the mono-static implementation.
